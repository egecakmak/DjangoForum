# DjangoForum
A very simple forum developed in Django
A simple and primitive forum I developed to learn back end development with Django framework, also used Bootstrap for the front end. <br>
It consists of features such as user registration and login, starting threads and posting comments. <br>
There are many known issues with it and this project will not be maintained.
